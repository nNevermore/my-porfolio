# How I created this portfolio?
## Project plan: Creating a portfolio for a programmer

1. **Project goal**
    - Create a programmer's portfolio to present skills and experience.
2. **Competition analysis**
   - Most of the portfolios had similar content. The ones that took a long time to load were off-putting. Some had nice interactive animations. Adding your own articles added prestige to the site. I didn't like sites with non-standard font sizes. By adding your own photo, the owner increased sympathy for himself. Expanding the projects section added professionalism.
3. **Target audience**
    - Potential employers and colleagues (e.g., clients).
4. **Accessibility languages**
    - As accessibility languages, I am choosing english and polish.
5. **Portfolio contents**
    - Front section (about me).
    - Project examples (description, technologies used, links to source code repositories).
    - Blog or section with technical articles.
    - Contact (contact form, links to social media, email).
6. **Technologies and tools**
    - Selection of front-end technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript (frameworks: Next.js (React)) and more.
    - Selection of back-end technologies: Node.js, Next.js Runtime and more.
    - Database selection: PostgreSQL (drizzle-kit).
    - Version control tools: Git, GitHub.
    - Deployment tools: Vercel.
    - Testing tools: Vitest, storybook,
    - Hosting: Netlify, AWS Amplify.
    - Monitoring tools: Sentry.
    - Build tools: Docker, Docker Compose.
    - Text editor: Visual Studio Code (Eslint, Prettier).
    - Translation tools: crowdin
    - Logger: pino
7. **Project structure**
     - The typical Next.js project structure with the use of App Router. The structure is designed for modularity, which makes it easier to manage and expand the application. The pages are divided into directories such as (auth) and (unauth), which makes it easier to navigate the code. Additionally, support for i18n (internationalization) has been added.

8. **Timeline**
    - Creating a detailed timeline with project implementation stages (e.g., analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment).
9. **Testing**
    - Planning and conducting functional, unit, and integration tests.
10. **Deployment**
    - Selection of hosting platform.
    - Configuration of the production environment.
    - Deployment plan.
11. **Promotion**
    - Strategies for promoting the portfolio (e.g., social media, interest groups, SEO).
12. **Maintenance and updates**
    - Planning regular updates and addition of new projects.
    - Monitoring and fixing any potential errors.
